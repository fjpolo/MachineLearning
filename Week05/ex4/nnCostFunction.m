%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
%neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m
%
% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.
%
% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.

% 1. Expand the 'y' output values into a matrix of single values (see ex4.pdf Page 
%5). This is most easily done using an eye() matrix of size num_labels, with 
%vectorized indexing by 'y'. A useful variable name would be "y_matrix", as this
I = eye(num_labels);
Y = I(y,:);

% 2. Perform the forward propagation:
% a1 equals the X input matrix with a column of 1's added (bias units) as the first column.
a1 = [ones(m, 1) X];
% z2 equals the product of a1 and theta1
z2 = a1*Theta1';
% a2 is the result of passing z2 through g()
% Then add a column of bias units to a2(as the first column).
a2 = sigmoid(z2);
a2 = [ones(size(z2, 1), 1) a2];
% z3 = a2*Theta2';
z3 = a2*Theta2';
% â€‹a3 is the result of passing z3 through g()
a3 = sigmoid(z3);
% a3 is the hypothesis
h = a3;

% 3. Compute the unregularized cost, using a3, Y and m (the number of 
%training examples). Note that the 'h' argument inside the log() function is 
%exactly a3. Cost should be a scalar value. Since y_matrix and a3 are both 
%matrices, you need to compute the double-sum.
% Remember to use element-wise multiplication with the log() function. We're 
%using the natural log, not log10().

% Penalty
p = sum(sum(Theta1(:, 2:end).^2, 2))+sum(sum(Theta2(:, 2:end).^2, 2));
% Cost
%J = sum(sum((-Y).*log(h) - (1-Y).*log(1-h), 2))/m + lambda*p/(2*m);
J = (1/m)*sum(sum((-Y).*log(h) - (1-Y).*log((1-h))));

%
% Regularized version
%
p1 = (lambda/m)*[zeros(size(Theta1, 1), 1) Theta1(:, 2:end)];
p2 = (lambda/m)*[zeros(size(Theta2, 1), 1) Theta2(:, 2:end)];
%
regularizer = (lambda/(2*m))*(sum(sum(Theta1(:,2:end).^2)) + sum(sum(Theta2(:,2:end).^2)));
J = J + regularizer;

%
% Back propagation
%

% Calculate sigmas
% delta_j(3) = a_j(3)-y_j
sigma3 = a3-Y;
% delta(2)' = ((Theta(2))' * delta(3)) .* g'(z(2))
sigma2 = (sigma3*Theta2).*sigmoidGradient([ones(size(z2, 1), 1) z2]);
% Don't forget to remove delta_0(2)
sigma2 = sigma2(:, 2:end);

% Accumulate gradients
delta_1 = (sigma2'*a1);
delta_2 = (sigma3'*a2);

% Gradient
Theta1_grad = delta_1./m + p1;
Theta2_grad = delta_2./m + p2;

% =========================================================================

% Unroll gradients
grad = [Theta1_grad(:) ; Theta2_grad(:)];
